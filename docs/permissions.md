# Permission modes

Choose how Ariadne handles an ACP agent's tool-permission questions. The mode
belongs to a repository, and every agent that works in it follows it. The
default is `auto`, which keeps routine work moving. Choose `ask` when you want
to decide each request, or `learn` when repeated approved requests in one
repository should stop interrupting you.

## Set a repository's mode

Pass `--permission-mode` when you register a repository, or change it later:

```sh
ariadne repo add ~/projects/api --permission-mode learn
ariadne repo update <repo-id> --permission-mode ask
```

In the desktop app, open **Repositories**, then register or edit a repository
and choose **Permission requests**. The repositories table shows each
repository's mode, and so does `ariadne repo ls`.

The accepted values are `auto`, `ask`, and `learn`. A repository registered
without one uses `auto`. The change applies to the next agent launched in the
repository; an agent already running keeps the mode it started with.

Which repository applies:

- A task's author and reviewers use the task's repository.
- A goal's orchestrator uses the goal's first repository.
- A resumed outside conversation uses the registered repository its directory
  is in. Outside every registered repository, it uses `auto`.

The mode cannot be set per task or in `~/.ariadne/config.toml`. A
`permission_mode` key left in `config.toml` stops the daemon from starting, so
remove it.

## What each mode does

| Mode | Behaviour | Use it when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `auto` | Ariadne selects an allowing option automatically. | You accept the agent's requested tool access by default. |
| `ask` | Ariadne shows every permission request in the console and waits for your answer. | You want to approve or deny each request yourself. |
| `learn` | Ariadne asks the first time, then remembers an allowing answer for a matching request. | You want review at first use without repeating the same approval. |

For `ask` and a new `learn` request, `ariadne attention` marks the session as
waiting. Open it with `ariadne attach <session-id>`. The console shows the
choices as a picker: move with ↑ and ↓ or press a number key, and Enter
answers. With stdin or stdout redirected the choices are a numbered list
instead, and the number typed on a line answers it. The desktop app draws the
same console in a terminal pane, so the same picker and the same keys answer
it there. All of them send the selected answer to the same session.

`auto` chooses an allowing option when one exists. If the request offers no
options, it is cancelled. In `learn`, Ariadne remembers only an allowing
answer. A denial is never saved.

## What `learn` remembers

`learn` keeps an approval per repository, tool name, and tool kind. An approval
for one repository does not grant it in another. The memory survives a daemon
restart and is used only for later requests with the same three values. Change
the repository to `ask` when you want to review a matching request again.
